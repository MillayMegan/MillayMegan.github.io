I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Right, gimme a Pepsi free.</p>

                <p class="text-dark">Of course they run. But for recreation, for fun. Run for fun? Ha-ha, what the kind of fun is that? (Another old man begins to laugh.) (Blacksmith Shop) (Marty arrives in town. He jumps off his horse and runs into Doc's shop.)Emmett! (Marty is keeping his eye on the speedometer and talking to himself.) Come on, come on. (He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie.) You better hold on to something, Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!! (There is a big explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on the car she was climbing on.) Ahh! Golly.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>No, no, no, no, no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids! (The DeLorean) (Inside Marty and Jennifer are seated in the passenger seat while Doc is driving.) Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>(to George) Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? (George grabs his bike and rides off.) Stella, another one of these kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house. (Bedroom) (Marty jerks awake. He's in a bed in a darkened room. He hears someone moving around.) Mom, is that you? There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>
               
               <br>
               
               <p>(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">(probably remembering the 1955 Doc's model of the Hill Valley square the night of the thunderstorm.) Yeah, I know, Doc, it's not to scale. It's okay, Doc. Alright. Tomorrow night, Sunday, we'll load the DeLorean on to the tracks here on the spur right by the old abandoned silver mine. The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line 3 miles into Clayton...Shonash Ravine. The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning. We'll stop it here, uncouple the cars from the tender, throw the switchtrack, and hijack - borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine. According to my calculations we'll hit 88 miles per hour just before we hit the edge of the ravine, at which point we'll instantaneously arrive in 1985 and coast safely across the completed bridge. What does this mean? (points to a small sign) Point of no return? That's our failsafe point. Up until that point we can stop the locomotive before it plunges over the ravine. But once we pass that windmill, it's the future or bust. (Later)
